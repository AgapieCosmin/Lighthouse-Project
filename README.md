# Lighthouse-Project
This project entails designing a lighthouse light signal device in OrCAD, using PCB design principles andcomponents like a 555 timer and a 4017 decade counter. The 555 timer serves as a clock pulse generator, providing asteady pulse frequency to the 4017 counter. This counter then sequentially activates each of its ten output pins.
